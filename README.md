## Setup Firebase Project

### Firestore
Create products and users collections and carts, checkoutSessions and orders ones optionally.

#### Products Collection
![products-collection](https://github.com/jp-quintana/readme/assets/87621233/c9606b47-a7d3-4c94-a7bc-9f2ba9c5282f)
Product collection holds both variants and skus collection.
- collection: must match one of the allowed skus in CollectionPage component.
- price: sets actual price. Variant doc handles discount logic.

#### Variants Subcollection
![variants-subcollection-1](https://github.com/jp-quintana/readme/assets/87621233/a83332c8-e94d-4c94-ac99-bdf75cc28d51)
Each variant represents a different color.
- productId: should hold parent doc id.
- images: same id as folder which contains corresponding variant image in cloude storage. And src should be the link provided by cloud storage when uploading corresponding image.
- variantPrice: should hold a number equal or less to product price. If variantPrice < price, then the product variant will be showed as "on sale" in UI.

#### Skus Subcollection
![skus-subcollection-1](https://github.com/jp-quintana/readme/assets/87621233/699d172b-3cd2-45b9-95e7-2d3898765926)
Although these docs are children of product doc, skus are specific to the product variant, not the product itself. Say for example, if variant has 5 sizes, there should be 5 sku docs, each one representing a different size. If the product has 2 colors, each with 5 sizes, you need to create 10 sku docs.
- productId: should hold parent doc id.
- variantId: should hold corresponding variant doc id.
- value: this is the sku value. It's currently not used in the app itself. App uses the sku doc id generated by firebase.

### Cloud Storage
![cloud-storage-example](https://github.com/jp-quintana/readme/assets/87621233/1b4be5df-8267-4bc9-8437-c809262c727a)
Each image should be stored in a folder with a name that corresponds to its respective ID. Aditionally each image folder should be stored in the "product-images" repository. The "src" is obtained by clicking the link inside the red rectangle. See image above and the one in Variants Subcollection section.
